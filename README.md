## What is SAP?

SAP (**S**ystems, **A**pplications & **P**roducts for Data Processing) is an integrated suite of applications and modules designed to 
work together to handle data processing for large companies. SAP R/1 (the first version of SAP) was first developed in Germany in 1972.
SAP is compatible with multiple platforms and operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and UNIX. 

## Why SAP?

### SAP Architecture

The current verison of SAP software is known as SAP ERP Central Component (ECC). Previously, it was SAP R/3, where the R stood for "Real-time data processing" and the "3" was for "3-tier". The three tiers of SAP are:
  - The Presentation Layer/Server
  - The Application Layer/Server
  - The Database Layer/Server

The presentation layer of SAP consists of the SAP GUI


  
The sole purpose of R/3 is to provide a suite of tightly integrated, large-scale business applications. The standard functional modules
shipped with the standard SAP package are the following:
- PP (Production Planning)
- MM (Materials Management)
- SD (Sales and Distribution)
- FI (Financial Accounting)
- CO (Controlling)
- AM (Fixed Assets Management)
- PS (Project System)
- WF (Workflow)
- IS (Industry Solutions)
- HR (Human Resources)
- PM (Plant Maintenance)
- QM (Quality Management)
